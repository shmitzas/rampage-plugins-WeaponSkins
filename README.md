## Features
- MySQL & sqlite database support
- Fully functioning in-game skin menu
- Compatible with CounterStrikeSharp WeaponPaints database
- Long-term stattrak tracking
- Player-based skin name localization
- Completely game-based econ data dumping (no network required)

## Main Configuration
The `config.toml` should have the following structure in `Main` section:
```toml
[Main]
StorageBackend = "inherit"
InventoryUpdateBackend = "hook"
SyncFromDatabaseWhenPlayerJoin = falses
```

#### `StorageBackend`
When set to `inherit`, the plugin use the database configuration from swiftlys2 database configuration.

When set to `sqlite`, the plugin use its own file-based sqlite database.

#### `InventoryUpdateBackend`
Recommended to set to `hook` for now. Another option is `inventory` but its deprecated.

#### `SyncFromDatabaseWhenPlayerJoin`
When set to true, the plugin will automatically synchronize skin data from database when a player join.

The update is asynchronous so it won't introduce lags in theory.


## Item Permissions
Gate entire feature groups with a single permission string in `config.toml`:
```toml
[Main.ItemPermissions]
WeaponSkins = "vip"
KnifeSkins = "vip"
GloveSkins = "vip"
Stickers = "vip"
Keychains = "vip"
Agents = "vip"
```
Leave a value empty or remove it to keep the feature available to everyone. Players without the required permission cannot open the related menus, and any equipped cosmetics of that type are hidden until they regain access.
